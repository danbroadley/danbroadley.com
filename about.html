    <h2>About the Artist</h2>
    <div class='content'>
      <img class='illustration' src='/images/content/the_artist_at_work_2.jpg' />
      <p>Daniel Broadley studied painting at Wimbledon School of Art and Brighton University. It was here he developed an interest in drawing the figure and the beauty of line.</p>
      <p>Dan worked as a freelance modelmaker for several years producing mainly figurative sculptures clients in museums, film, retail, and for other artists including Ron Mueck, David Mach and Marc Quinn. Some pieces were in miniature, others were up to twenty-five feet high. It was through using large blocks of polystyrene to create these large pieces that Daniel discovered his interest in carving, which led him to a course in stone carving at Tout quarry in Portland, Dorset.</p>
      <p>In 2003 Dan completed a Masters in film Production Design at the National Film and Television School, a course that united his skills in 2D and 3D art. This led to a period working as a draughtsman and storyboard artist on several films.</p>
      <p>During this period Daniel began to devote more time to his passion, creating sculptures in stone. His sculptures are made to commission and sold in galleries around London.</p>
